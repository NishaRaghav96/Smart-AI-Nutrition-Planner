Smart AI Nutrition Planner is a Streamlit-based app that generates personalized meal plans.
It takes user inputs like weight, age, gender, goal, and food preference.
The app calculates calorie and protein targets using the BMR formula.
It splits daily nutrition into breakfast, lunch, and dinner portions.
Using linear programming (PuLP), it selects optimal dishes from the dataset.
Meals are shown in styled orange cards with dish names and nutrition info.
Calories and protein values are rounded to 2 decimal places.
Dish list is shown without default row numbers and includes custom S.No.
Lottie animation adds an engaging visual at the top.
A reset button allows users to try again with different inputs.
